# BlocktrAIn - (WIP)
## Submission for the 2018 Dorahacks Ark Hackathon in Toronto, Won 3rd Place
Initially developed in October of 2018

## Summary
A Python library which gives users access to continually improving pre-trained Keras models to be used for transfer learning.

## Idea
Transfer learning has the potential to be an extremely useful tool for indendent ML projects. When someone might not have the 
resources to train an extremely deep model for a significant number of epochs, they can just load up a pre-trained model and 
retrain it just slightly for a novel application. Unfortunately, a consistent format for models, packaged in an accessible 
way, is a bit difficult to find. We wanted to provide users a way to access continually improving models on a growing number 
of datasets. Each dataset will have what's conceptually a blockchain, where the proof-of-work is an improved model.

## Results
The concept and code we'd implemented so far won us third place at the hackathon. I'm pretty proud of this outcome for my 
first hackathon and certainly hope to improve this project as I learn more about blockchain/Keras best practices.
